# Worker Data Manager

`This project was developed in Python using the Kivy framework to build a cross-platform graphical user interface.`

This is a simple Worker Data Manager coded in Python. I made this Python code to practice my current programming skills.
I've learned a lot about Kivy, Object-Oriented Programming, and File Management, so I made this code to practice all that I've learned until now.

# What I used

Python 3

Kivy (GUI framework)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

File handling and data persistence

Basic input validation and user authentication

# Features
